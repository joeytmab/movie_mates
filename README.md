AS A movie viewer
I WANT a social app for movies	
SO THAT I can access information, comment, rate and chat about them!

The purpose of our app is for users to create an account using a new username and rate movies of different genres they may search for.
In addition to rating movies, the application also allows for real-time chat giving users an opportunity to have open discussions with other users that demonstrate similar tastes in film and cinema.

## Initial Design Concept

Initially we as a team agreed we wanted to keep it simple and straight forward with a log in and registration page, a profile personalization page, a ratings page and a chat or comments page.

## Functions
The app manages to seamlessly take you through the log in and registration page when the user indicates a need to create a profile. 
Once that is set up, it then allows for the user to move through the search engine to look up movies using the OMBD api.
They can then chose to chat with another person with similar views by clicking on the chat feature which is using the socket.io


## Future Development 
For future development we'd like to add more variety with the ratings system by implementing our own 1-5 descriptive and unique choices.

We'd like to add the ability to start group forums.

To add a recommend feature to connect users to specific group forums.

Polish the chat functionality on the app.
